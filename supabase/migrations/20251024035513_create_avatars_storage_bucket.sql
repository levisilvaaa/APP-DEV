/*
  # Create Avatars Storage Bucket

  1. Storage
    - Creates a new storage bucket called 'avatars'
    - Allows public access for viewing avatar images
    - Sets file size limits and allowed MIME types for images
  
  2. Security
    - Enable RLS on storage.objects
    - Add policy for authenticated users to upload their own avatars
    - Add policy for anyone to read avatar images (public access)
    - Add policy for users to update/delete their own avatars
